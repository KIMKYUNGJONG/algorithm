# Arrays and Strings
  - Array is a sequential collection of elements of same data type
  - and string is an array of unicode characters
  - Both of them are closely related

## Two Pointers Technique
- Scenario 1: Iterating an array from two ends to the middle
  - [Reverse String](https://github.com/irnkwon/algorithm/blob/master/problems/leetcode/344.md)
- Scenario 2: One slow-runner and one fast-runner at the same time
  - [Remove Element](https://github.com/irnkwon/algorithm/blob/master/problems/leetcode/27.md)

## Operations

| Access    | Search    | Insertion | Deletion  |
| :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: |
| O(1)      | O(n)      | O(n)      | O(n)      |

- Insert or delete item at the end: O(1)
