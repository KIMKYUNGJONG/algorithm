
# Stacks and Queues

- Linear data structure
  - The data is organized in a linear order in which elements are linked one after the other
- Limited access data structures, which is a subcase of sequential data structures
  - <strong>Linked List:</strong> sequential data structures
  - <strong>Array:</strong> random access data structures
- No indexing

## Stacks
- LIFO (Last in, First out)
- Pancake, Hamburger
- <strong>Functions:</strong>
  - Push, Pop, and Peek
  
## Queues
