<br /> Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

<strong>Follow up:</strong>

- Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
- Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

<strong>Constraints:</strong>

- 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4
- It's guaranteed that nums[i] fits in a 32 bit-signed integer.
- k >= 0

## Example 1

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

## Example 2

```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

## Solution
### Approach 1: Using Pop and Unshift
```
var rotate = function(nums, k) {
  var poppedNum = 0;
  for (i=0; i<k; i++) {
    poppedNum = nums.pop();
    nums.unshift(poppedNum);
  }
  return nums;
};
```

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
