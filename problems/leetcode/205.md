<br /> Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. 
No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

<strong>Note:</strong>
You may assume both s and t have the same length.

## Example 1

```
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```

## Example 2

```
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```

## Example 3

```
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```

## Solution
### Approach 1: Hash Table
```
var isIsomorphic = function(s, t) {
  let hash = {};
  let arr = [];

  for (let i=0; i<s.length; i++) {
    if (!hash[s[i]]) {
      if (arr.includes(t[i])) return false;
      arr.push(t[i]);
      hash[s[i]] = t[i];
    }

    else {
      if (hash[s[i]] !== t[i]) {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }
  return true;
};
```
