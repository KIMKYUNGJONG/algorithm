<br /> Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of [printable ascii characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

## Example 1

```
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

## Example 2

```
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

## Solution
### Approach 1: Two Pointers
### 
```
var reverseString = function(s) {
  let start = 0;
  let end = s.length-1;
  let temp = "";

  for (let i=0; i<s.length/2; i++) {
    temp = s[start];
    s[start] = s[end];
    s[end] = temp;
    start++;
    end--;
  }
};
```
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
