<br /> You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have. 
Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. 
Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

<strong>Note:</strong>
- S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
- The characters in J are distinct.

## Example 1

```
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

## Example 2

```
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

## Solution
### Approach 1: Hash Table
```
var numJewelsInStones = function(J, S) {
  let splittedJ = J.split('');
  let splittedS = S.split('');
  let hash = {};
  let output = 0;

  for (let i=0; i<splittedJ.length; i++) {
    if (!hash[splittedJ[i]]) hash[splittedJ[i]] = 0;
  }

  for (let j=0; j<splittedS.length; j++) {
    hash[splittedS[j]]++;
  }

  for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(hash)) {
    if (!Number.isNaN(value)) {
      output += value;
    }
  }
  return output;
};
```

- Space Complexity: O(n)
