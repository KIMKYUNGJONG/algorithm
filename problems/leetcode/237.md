<br /> Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9

## Example 1

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

## Example 2

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

## Solution
### Approach 1: Swap with Next Node
```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */

var deleteNode = function(node) {
    node.val = node.next.val;
    node.next = node.next.next;
};
```

- Time Complexity: O(1)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
