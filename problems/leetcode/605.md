<br /> Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. 
However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), 
and a number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

<strong>Note:</strong>
1. The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.
2. The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].
3. n is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.

## Example 1

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: True
```

## Example 2

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: False
```

## Solution
### Approach 1: Single Scan
```
var canPlaceFlowers = function(flowerbed, n) {
  let cnt = 0;
  for (let i=0; i<flowerbed.length; i++) {
    if (flowerbed[i] === 0) {
      if (flowerbed.length === 1) {
        cnt = 1;
      }
      if (flowerbed[i-1] === 0 && flowerbed[i+1] === 0) {
        cnt++;
        flowerbed[i] = 1;
      } else if (flowerbed[i-1] === undefined && flowerbed[i+1] === 0) {
        cnt++;
        flowerbed[i] = 1;
      } else if (flowerbed[i-1] === 0 && flowerbed[i+1] === undefined) {
        cnt++;
        flowerbed[i] = 1;
      }
    }
  }
  return cnt >= n ? true : false;
};
```

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
